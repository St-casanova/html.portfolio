<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a singer, songwriter and a performer. I am an adherent of the Afrobeats genre of music. 
  I draw my inspiration from my immediate surrouding. I have artists whose style of singing influence 
  my sinmging career, both in Nigeria and Abroad. Music for me is my getaway from all the troubles in 
  the world. Music is my safe haven. I find peace and tranquility whenever i write or sing. I am on a 
  journey of creating something different from the norm yet Iconic. I want to leave a lasting legacy as 
  one of the greatest singers of all time </p>

<p>When I am not writing or singing you will find me coding. I so much enjoy coding as this ensures my 
creative mind stays active </p>

<p>When I am not doing any of the afforementioned, I spend my time engaging in sporting activities.
  I am huge soccer fan and a die die hard Manchester United Football Club fan. Other than soccer,
i follow other sports like: Basketball, Boxing, MMA just to mention but few. </p>
